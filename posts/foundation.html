      <h2>What Surprised Me the Most About Human Skills Learning</h2>
    </u>

    <h4>
      Throughout my time in foundations, I have discovered new things about myself that have stuck with me.<br />
      Exploring my ego has been eye-opening. Engaging in the mental exercises has brought about a positive shift within
      me.<br />
      I have always thought of myself as being a person free from negativity, with empathy being one of my
      strengths.<br />
      However, the listening and reflection exercises revealed a new and indescribable experience.

      <h2>Three Things I've Learned About Myself and My Ego</h2>
    </u>

    <u>
      <h2>Listening and Looping:</h2>
    </u>
    <h4>
      Listening definately. When i have taken the time to truly listen to the people<br />
      who have agreed to practice this method with myself, It has deepened my understanding of the people around
      me,<br />

      Including my wife, who did not have to practice this but she has been helping me a lot throughout
      Foundations<br />
      and i can't hank her enough for this. Seeing the reactions of people sometimes a bit of alaugh too.<br />
      I was surprised at how much someone, anyone, will open up if you are prepared to actually listen<br />
      and give a response back relative to what they have been talking about, that was a new one for me.<br />
      I dont think that's three things but close enough.

      <h2>The Roles: Empathy, Values, and Self-Awareness</h2>
    </u>

    <h4>
      Understanding the importance of self-awareness and self-regulation in programming has been a significant<br />
      lesson for me. Recognizing and managing my emotions, thoughts, and reactions throughout these past weeks<br />
      has been essential in getting myself through this.<br />

      Empathy, in particular, stands out as a crucial attribute.<br />
      The ability to empathize and connect with others on an emotional level greatly enhances collaboration and<br />
      productivity in any work environment. I admit i have not done very much online interaction with other
      students<br />
      this is something i am starting to get a better handle on and i will not shy from the task away when needed.<br />
      These human skills have been unexpectedly enlightening in an industry where I least expected it.

      <h2>The Most Challenging Parts for Me</h2>
    </u>

    <h4>
      I was surprised by the emphasis on cultural awareness.<br />
      I have never considered myself to have any real type of culture at all.<br />
      However, I now realize I have just never looked deep into that side of<br />
      myself to realize that I actually do have a culture of my own.<br />
      Through research and reflection, I discovered a deeper connection to my own cultural roots.<br />
      My family, I found, is my cultural identity. Realizing this has been a new experience for me.<br />
      I think I have just misinterpreted the word all these years.

    <u>
      <h2>Why Do I Think You Teach a Lot of Human Skills for a Programming School?</h2>
    </u>

    <h4>
      I believe I know the answer to this and it can be debated with me anytime.<br />
      The reason you teach this way, especially in foundations, belongs to a couple of things.<br />
      Firstly, it would be the way the generations of these days think.<br />
      They believe they are the most progressive generation there has been,<br />
      not realizing that every generation before them has been the most progressive.<br />
      It is how we are evolving. And that to me is one of the reasons you have an open minded education
      curriculum.<br />
      This is not a negative comment more of a positive, Keep it up i say.<br />

      The other reason I see your establishment teaching in this method would have to do with letting someone
      truly<br />
      find out about themselves before they go headfirst into a career. This career, which I see firsthand on a daily
      basis<br />
      demands a lot of focus and self-control, and thatâ€™s not for everyone.<br />
      So, giving someone the time to reflect on themselves and the reassurance given allows a person to decide<br />
      whether or not this is the right path for them. If it is, great! If not, there is no drama or ridicule.<br />
      If Iâ€™m wrong, then just let me know, but Iâ€™m pretty sure I am not far off.<br />
      Thank you for your time.
