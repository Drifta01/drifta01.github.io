        experience."

        Until recently, the conventional thinking was that our brains were wired at birth and therefore unchangeable. In actuality, our
        brains are like malleable plastic that is constantly being reshaped by our daily experiences."<cite><u>Dev Academy</u></cite>

      <p>
        My ultimate goal is to obtain the necessary qualifications for a career in technology, allowing me to secure a remote position with
        a stable income to provide for my wife and children.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strengths lie in innovation and a willingness to continually learn. I consider myself clever enough to manage a wide range of
        problems in my day-to-day life. Working with mechanical, electrical, and digital machinery has been the primary focus of my entire
        career. Over 20 years ago, I became the owner and operator of a business, which taught me a great deal about workplace challenges
        and how to overcome them. Dealing with employees can be difficult at times, but I always practiced patience and understanding, which
        I found to be very effective in resolving issues. I believe that staying composed and listening carefully can easily resolve most of
        the problems faced. Throughout many years in the industry of digital and offset printing, my brother and I accomplished tasks that
        at times seemed impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        My limitations are more physical than mental. I sustained an injury about 7 years ago, resulting in 5 compound fractures in my
        ankle, making it challenging for me to move around continuously. Due to this, I believe that remote or hybrid style employment would
        be the best fit for me. One of my challenges is explaining something until I have full confidence in the subject. At the moment, I
        find it difficult to explain many of the things I have learned so far and in the previous months leading up to this course. However,
        I learn something new every day, so I anticipate not having a problem explaining the subjects I am learning through this course in
        the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main source of assistance is my brother, who has been in this industry for a long time. However, I know I can also reach out to
        others on the Discord page anytime.
      </p>
      <p>
        In facing pressure, I commit to collaborating with fellow learners and facilitators. Should the demands become excessive, I will
        prioritize self-care by taking a break. My goal is to achieve success, and I am determined not to let challenges escalate beyond my
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have certain family commitments, but fortunately, my wife understands and supports my goals. She is assisting me as I go through
        this course, and I am grateful for her understanding. With her help, I am able to effectively manage and fulfill all of my
        commitments without any difficulty.&#9775;
