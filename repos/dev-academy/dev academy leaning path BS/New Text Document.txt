my long term goal is to get fully educated on web development so i can get employed, preferebly in a remote job with an income so i can support myself and my wife and children.

my strengths would be innovation and willingness to always learn more, my limitations are both physical and mental.
my mobility is heavily restricted these days. i do have a hard time explaining what i have learned, i think understand all iv'e been learning but sometimes when im asked to describe what iv'e learned i just can't find the words to explain it.

i would like to see my skills with online communication improve, i'm not good at talking about myself i know this already.

i will do as much as possible to work alongside other learners, facilitators etc...
if and when things start to build up on me i will take a break , my goal here is to acheive, so i will not let things get out of hand.

my main source of help is my brother who has been in this industry for along time now, but i know i can reach out to others on the discord page anytime.

my expectations from the facilitation team is to do there best at trying to help me acheive my goals, no'one is expecting miracles i think we all get out of this as to what we put in.

i do have family commitments but i am lucky that my wife is understanding of my goals and is helping me while i go through this course.
all of my commitments are now easily acheived. 
Certainly! Here's a summary of the key points from the article on neural plasticity:

- **Neural Plasticity**: The brain's ability to adapt and reorganize itself, not just during infancy but throughout an individual's lifespan.

- **Case Studies**: Research, such as Maguire's study on London taxi drivers, demonstrates that intensive practice, like spatial navigation, can lead to structural brain changes, such as increased hippocampus size.

- **Sensory Substitution**: Devices that convert one type of sensory input into another, like visual-to-tactile or visual-to-auditory, can help rewire the brain's sensory cortex, especially in blind individuals.

- **Caution Against Hype**: While neural plasticity is a significant discovery, the article warns against overestimating its potential and misusing scientific terms to make exaggerated claims about psychological changes.

Definition: Growth Mindset is the belief that one’s abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, hard work, and perseverance1. It contrasts with a fixed mindset, which views abilities as static and unchangeable.
Relevance: Adopting a Growth Mindset is crucial because it empowers individuals to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, learn from criticism, and find inspiration in others’ success2. It’s relevant for personal development, academic achievement, and professional growth.
Personal Reflection: While exploring Growth Mindset, many find the concept of neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections—particularly enlightening. It reinforces the idea that we can indeed change and improve our cognitive abilities over time.
Integration into Learning: To integrate a Growth Mindset into learning, focus on effort rather than innate talent, view challenges as opportunities to grow, and reflect on learning strategies to overcome obstacles.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The concepts of Growth Mindset and Neuroplasticity are deeply interconnected and can significantly shape and influence your learning plans and strategies in the following ways:

Encouraging Active Learning: Knowing that the brain can form new neural connections throughout life, you can approach learning with the confidence that your efforts will lead to cognitive growth1.
Fostering Resilience: A Growth Mindset instills resilience, allowing you to view setbacks as natural parts of the learning process and opportunities to strengthen neural pathways1.
Promoting Continuous Improvement: With a Growth Mindset, you’re more likely to seek out new challenges and learning opportunities, stimulating neuroplasticity and leading to continuous improvement1.
Adapting Learning Strategies: Understanding neuroplasticity encourages the adaptation of learning strategies to ensure they align with how the brain changes in response to new information2.
Enhancing Motivation: A Growth Mindset can increase motivation to learn, as you believe in the potential to develop your abilities further1.
Improving Learning Outcomes: By engaging in activities that challenge the brain, you can leverage neuroplasticity to acquire new skills and knowledge, leading to better learning outcomes1.
To integrate these concepts into your learning plan and strategy, consider the following actions:

Set Dynamic Goals: Create goals that not only reflect your current abilities but also push you to expand your skills and knowledge.
Embrace Challenges: Actively seek out new and difficult tasks to promote brain growth and development.
Reflect and Adjust: Regularly reflect on your learning experiences and be willing to adjust your strategies based on what is most effective.
Seek Feedback: Use feedback as a tool for growth, allowing it to guide the strengthening of your neural connections.
Practice Persistence: Understand that mastery takes time and practice, and that each effort contributes to your brain’s development.
