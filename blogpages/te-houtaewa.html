   <u> <h1 id="te-h1">E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka</h1></u>

    <h1>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</h1>

      <h2 class="te-h2">
        Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies.<br />
        One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short
        distance away. <br />He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.<br />
        Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived
        there.<br />
        Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe
        (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly.<br />
        On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the
        hill Whangatauatia. <br /><br />
        While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately<br />
        recognised.
