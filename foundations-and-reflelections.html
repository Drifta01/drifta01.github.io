    <u><h2>What Surprised Me the Most About Human Skills Learning</h2></u>

    <p>
      Throughout my time in foundations, I have discovered new things about myself that have stuck with me. Exploring my ego has been
      eye-opening. Engaging in the mental exercises has brought about a positive shift within me. I have always thought of myself as being a
      person free from negativity, with empathy being one of my strengths. However, the listening and reflection exercises revealed a new
      and indescribable experience.

    <u><h2>Three Things I've Learned About Myself and My Ego</h2></u>

    <u><h2>Listening and Looping:</h2></u>
    <p>
      Listening definately. When i have taken the time to truly listen to the people who have agreed to practice this method with myself, It
      has deepened my understanding of the people around me, Including my wife, who did not have to practice this but she has been helping
      me a lot throughout Foundations and i can't hank her enough for this. Seeing the reactions of people sometimes a bit of alaugh too. I
      was surprised at how much someone, anyone, will open up if you are prepared to actually listen and give a response back relative to
      what they have been talking about, that was a new one for me. I dont think that's three things but close enough.
    </p>

    <u><h2>The Roles: Empathy, Values, and Self-Awareness</h2></u>

    <p>
      Understanding the importance of self-awareness and self-regulation in programming has been a significant lesson for me. Recognizing
      and managing my emotions, thoughts, and reactions throughout these past weeks has been essential in getting myself through this.
      Empathy, in particular, stands out as a crucial attribute. The ability to empathize and connect with others on an emotional level
      greatly enhances collaboration and productivity in any work environment. I admit i have not done very much online interaction with
      other students this is something i am starting to get a better handle on and i will not shy from the task away when needed. These
      human skills have been unexpectedly enlightening in an industry where I least expected it.
    </p>

    <u><h2>The Most Challenging Parts for Me</h2></u>

    <p>
      I was surprised by the emphasis on cultural awareness. I have never considered myself to have any real type of culture at all.
      However, I now realize I have just never looked deep into that side of myself to realize that I actually do have a culture of my own.
      Through research and reflection, I discovered a deeper connection to my own cultural roots. My family, I found, is my cultural
      identity. Realizing this has been a new experience for me. I think I have just misinterpreted the word all these years.

    <u><h2>Why Do I Think You Teach a Lot of Human Skills for a Programming School?</h2></u>

    <p>
      I believe I know the answer to this and it can be debated with me anytime. The reason you teach this way, especially in foundations,
      belongs to a couple of things. First, it would be the way generations think. we have always believed that "our generation" is the most
      progressive generation there has been, but rarely do we think about the fact that every generation before us has been the most
      progressive. It is how we are evolving. And that to me is one of the reasons you have an open minded education curriculum. This is not
      a negative comment more of a positive, Keep it up i say.<br />

      Secondly, I see your teaching in this method would have to do with letting someone truly find out about themselves before they go
      headfirst into a career. This career, which I see firsthand on a daily basis demands a lot of focus and self-control, and thatâ€™s not
      for everyone. So, giving someone the time to reflect on themselves and the reassurance given to them by staff allows a person to
      decide whether or not this is the right path for them. If it is, great! If not, there is no drama or ridicule. If Iâ€™m wrong, then just
      let me know, but Iâ€™m pretty sure I am not far off. Thank you for your time.
